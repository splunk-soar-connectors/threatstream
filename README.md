        -   Import email observable - **create_on_cloud** parameter has been added
        -   Import observables - **create_on_cloud** parameter has been added

**Asset Configuration Parameters**

-   **is_cloud_instance** - This boolean parameter is used to indicate whether the Anomali
    Threatstream instance is on the cloud. If the parameter is left unchecked, the app and its
    functionalities will internally consider it as an on-prem instance.

**Prerequisite for \[Delete Incident / Delete Actor / Delete Vulnerability / Delete Rule / Delete
Threat Bulletin\] actions**

-   The authenticated user in the app should have appropriate permissions (Organization Admin) for
    deleting the incidents/actors/vulnerabilities/rules/threat-bulletins on the Anomali Threatstream
    instance for these actions to be executed successfully.

**Behavior for \[Whois IP\] action**

-   If the action can fetch additional whois data for the provided IP then, the action will pass
    successfully with that additional data.
-   If the action is unable to fetch additional whois data for the provided IP then, the action will
    pass successfully without that additional data but with an appropriate message.

**Behavior for Domain Reputation**

-   The action will try to find an intelligence with the same name provided in the \[domain\]
    parameter in the Anomali ThreatStream instance. If it is not found, then 'None' will be
    displayed under the corresponding columns in the output view.
-   If the provided domain is not found as intelligence in the Anomali ThreatStream instance, then
    the user needs to import a domain observable with the provided domain as input and then try to
    re-run the \[domain reputation\] action.

**On Poll Functionality**

-   It fetches the incidents (belonging to the configured organization ID in the configuration
    parameters) and their intelligence data to ingest them as containers and artifacts.

-   Approaches for fetching incidents based on the **Ingest only incidents marked published**
    configuration parameter

      

    -   Parameter kept unchecked: Ingesting all the incidents irrespective of their publication
        status
    -   Parameter kept checked: Ingesting the incidents which are only in the published state

-   Types of polling

      

    -   Manual Polling

          

        -   All the incidents are fetched, controlled by the count mentioned in the container_count
            parameter in the oldest first order based on the **modified_ts** value of the incidents
            irrespective of the incidents fetched in the last run. If the user tries to run the
            manual polling again with a value less than the already ingested incidents, then, again
            the same incidents will be fetched starting from the oldest first and will be marked as
            duplicates. It is recommended to run manual polling using a relatively greater value in
            the container_count parameter to ensure all the incidents are ingested.
        -   The **modified_ts** time of the last fetched incident is not considered for consequent
            runs of the manual polling.

    -   Scheduled | Interval Polling

          

        -   Same functionality as manual polling along with the additional points mentioned below:

              

            -   **The maximum number of incidents to poll in the first run of the scheduled
                polling** configuration parameter governs the number of incidents fetched in the
                first run.
            -   The **modified_ts** time of the last fetched incident is stored in the
                **last_incident_time** key of the state file.
            -   For the consecutive runs, the incidents are fetched starting from the time stored in
                the **last_incident_time** key of the state file.
            -   Please provide a larger value in the **Maximum number of incidents to poll in the
                first run of the scheduled polling** configuration parameter to fetch all the
                existing (older) incidents in the first run itself. From the consecutive runs, the
                newly created or the modified incidents will be automatically ingested.

**Behavior for \[Create vulnerability / Update vulnerability / Create actor / Update Actor / Create
threat bulletin / Update threat bulletin\] actions**

-   Trusted circles are not available locally on On-prem (Hybrid) instance.

**Behavior for \[Create vulnerability / Update vulnerability / Create actor / Update Actor / Create
threat bulletin / Update threat bulletin / Create incident / Update incident\] actions**

-   The action uses different API endpoints for creating / updating an entity and associating
    intelligence, attachments, import sessions or comments to the entity.
-   If the action fails to associate the intelligence, attachments, import sessions or comments
    while creating an entity, the user can associate them by running the Update action with valid
    inputs.

**Confidence action parameter for import observable related actions**

-   For \[import file observable\] and \[import email observable\] actions user has to provide the
    confidence value in \[confidence\] action parameter.

-   For \[import domain observable\], \[import ip observable\], and \[import url observable\]
    actions ThreatStream automatically gives the confidence value based on some internal logical
    operations | processes as per the API documentation.

-   For \[import observable\] action user can provide confidence value in 'fields' parameter as
    {"confidence": \<confidence_value>}.

      

    -   For hash and email type of observable, the value of the confidence will be reflected.
    -   For domain, IP, and URL type of observable, the value of the confidence will be ignored.

**Behavior of import\_\<indicator_type>\_observable and the import_observables actions**

-   The action run just sends a request for importing the observable value to the Anomali server.

-   The action run is a success if a response of **202 Accepted** is returned by the Anomali API.
    The action does not wait for the observable to reflect on the Anomali UI.

-   The successful run of the actions does not guarantee the successful import of the observable on
    the Anomali server

      

    -   If the provided parameters and their expected combinations are correct, then the observable
        will be successfully imported after an indefinite interval of time (based on the Anomali
        server).
    -   If the provided parameters and their combinations are incorrect, then the action run would
        be a success (because the API does not return an error response for this and accepts the
        request) though the observable is not imported on the Anomali server.

-   It is recommended to add a required time delay between the action blocks which are dependent on
    the successful import of an observable.

-   To check if the observable was successfully imported, the user can run and check the **List
    Observables** action which fetches the observables in the latest first order (based on
    **created_ts** time).

## action: 'domain reputation'
Get information about a given domain

Type: **investigate**  
Read only: **True**

If nothing is found, this may be due to the format of the domain. Try excluding any subdomains (namely www). If there is still no information found, then it is because ThreatStream has no information on that domain. ThreatStream, however, may still have Passive DNS (PDNS) information on it, which can be found in extra data. If the limit parameter is not provided, then the default value (1000) will be considered as the value of the limit parameter.<br>Extra data includes PDNS, insights, and external resources. By default, extra data is not included in the response. You can update the flag params to include the extra data. The <b>search_exact_value</b> parameter searches for the exact domain on ThreatStream server. If this parameter is kept <b>true</b>, then the <b>extend_source</b> parameter will be ignored and no extra information will be available.

Terms of Use: Donuts Inc. provides this Whois service for information purposes, and to assist persons in obtaining information about or related to a domain name registration record. Donuts does not guarantee its accuracy. Users accessing the Donuts Whois service agree to use the data only for lawful purposes, and under no circumstances may this data be used to: a) allow, enable, or otherwise support the transmission by e-mail, telephone, or facsimile of mass unsolicited, commercial advertising or solicitations to entities other than the registrar’s own existing customers and b) enable high volume, automated, electronic processes that send queries or data to the systems of Donuts or any ICANN-accredited registrar, except as reasonably necessary to register domain names or modify existing registrations. When using the Donuts Whois service, please consider the following: The Whois service is not a replacement for standard EPP commands to the SRS service. Whois is not considered authoritative for registered domain objects. The Whois service may be scheduled for downtime during production or OT&E maintenance periods. Queries to the Whois services are throttled. If too many queries are received from a single IP address within a specified time, the service will begin to reject further queries for a period of time to prevent disruption of Whois service access. Abuse of the Whois system through data mining is mitigated by detecting and limiting bulk query access from single sources. Where applicable, the presence of a [Non-Public Data] tag indicates that such data is not made publicly available due to applicable data privacy laws or requirements. Should you wish to contact the registrant, please refer to the Whois records available through the registrar URL listed above. Access to non-public data may be provided, upon request, where it can be reasonably confirmed that the requester holds a specific legitimate interest and a proper legal basis for accessing the withheld data. Access to this data can be requested by submitting a request via the form found at https://donuts.domains/about/policies/whois-layered-access/ Donuts Inc. reserves the right to modify these terms at any time.

## action: 'import observables'
Import observables into ThreatStream

Type: **generic**  
Read only: **False**

<ul><li>For importing observables without approval, the user must provide indicator type in the field parameter (e.g - {"itype": "&lt;indicator_type&gt;"}) whereas, for importing observables with approval, the user must provide threat type in the field parameter (e.g - {"threat_type": "&lt;threat_type&gt;"}).</li><li>The "allow_unresolved" parameter will be passed in the API call if the "value" parameter is set to "domain" or "url" and "with_approval" parameter is set to "False".</li><li>The possible values of indicator type (itype) and threat_type are listed at the starting of the documentation. If the input contains any indicator type (itype) or threat_type value except the ones listed, the action will behave according to the API behavior.</li><li>For importing observables of type 'URL', 'IP' and 'Domain', Threatstream itself detects the confidence value whereas, for importing observables of type 'Email', 'File', the user must provide confidence value in the field parameter (e.g - {"itype": "&lt;indicator_type&gt;", "confidence": &lt;confidence_value&gt;}).</li><li>If both the "itype" and "threat_type" values are passed in the "fields" parameter when "with_approval" is set to "True", the action will behave according to the API behavior.</li></ul>
